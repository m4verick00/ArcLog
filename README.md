# ArcLogbook - Defensive Security Toolkit for Android

ArcLogbook is a privacy-first, local-first defensive security toolkit designed for Android devices. It provides comprehensive incident logging, threat intelligence aggregation, vulnerability tracking, metadata extraction, and AI-assisted analysis capabilities.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Legal & Ethical Notice

**IMPORTANT**: ArcLogbook is designed for authorized security research, incident response, and defensive security operations only. Users are responsible for ensuring all activities comply with local laws, regulations, and authorized usage policies. Any active testing capabilities require explicit authorization and are gated behind Expert Mode with consent dialogs.

## üîí Privacy & Security

- **Local-first architecture**: All data stored locally with SQLCipher encryption
- **No telemetry**: Zero data collection or transmission without explicit user consent
- **Biometric protection**: Optional biometric authentication for app access
- **Panic mode**: Quick data wipe/lock functionality
- **Network isolation**: Module-level network permissions with optional VPN/Tor routing

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Multi-Module Structure
- `app/` - Main application module
- `core/common/` - Shared UI components and utilities
- `core/database/` - Room database with SQLCipher encryption
- `core/network/` - Retrofit networking with security configurations
- `feature/*` - Individual feature modules (logbook, intel, metadata, etc.)

### Tech Stack
- **Language**: Kotlin
- **UI**: Jetpack Compose with Material 3
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture + MVVM
- **Database**: Room + SQLCipher
- **DI**: Hilt
- **Background**: WorkManager
- **Networking**: Retrofit + OkHttp

## üîß Build Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio Arctic Fox or newer
- Android SDK 26+ (Android 8.0+)
- Kotlin 1.9.10+

### Building the Project
```bash
# Clone the repository (when available)
git clone [repository-url]
cd ArcLogbook

# Build debug APK
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Build both flavors
./gradlew assembleFossDebug assembleFullDebug

# Run tests
./gradlew test
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest

# Generate baseline profiles (performance optimization)
./gradlew generateBaselineProfile
```

### APK Outputs
Built APKs are placed in the `apk/` directory:
- `apk/ArcLogbook-debug.apk` - Debug build
- `apk/ArcLogbook-release-unsigned.apk` - Release build (unsigned)

### Flavors
